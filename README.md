CSCI 55200 DATA VISUALIZATION 

##	I prepared a dataset containing agricultural information of Asian countries in the year 2002, as they more dependent on farming.


Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam.



Attributes: Agricultural_land(% of total land),Total Population, total Agricultural workers (%), Adult literacy rate, total water usage %, power consumption(kwh/person), food supply kg per person, sulfur emission (per year),Agriculture (% of GDP), Total_GDP.


```
Aim of the project is to know the influence of agriculture on countries economy.
```

## Three visualization techniques in d3 performed on dataset.
*	Parallel Co-ordinates 
*	Scatterplot matrix 
*	Pie chart

**Keep .html files in C:\xampp\htdocs location to execute them**

### Parallel Co-ordinates

### Pie chart

##	From above three Visualizations we can came to know fallowing inferences.

* Countries with more land like china, India, Russia, Kazakhstan has less attention to do agriculture when compared to other countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. 
Less than 50% of the land is used for agriculture in large area countries except Kazakhstan.
In contract, Countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam had more agricultural labor and supporting their countries GDP through farming. 
Countries with large population like China and India is having mixed economy of agriculture and industries. Agriculture income share in total GDP is less than 40 percent, whereas agricultural labor is less than 35%. It indicates less number of people moving through wards agriculture.

* Surprisingly, Japan had no agricultural land with less population when compared to other countries having highest GDP in Asia. It is more dependent on industries indicated by itâ€™s sulfur emissions. 

* Countries dependent more on agriculture had less adult literacy rate, In Constrict Kazakhstan has highest literacy rate. 
So, Countries having less land and more agricultural labor with less adult literacy rate are having slow growth in economies.
